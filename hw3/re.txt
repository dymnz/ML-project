 There are some modifications and reminders in your homework 3
 (1) We change the dataset, please download the lattest version of HW03 from e3 again.
 (2) 'beta'=0 should be modified as 'beta^(-1)'=0.01.
 (3) We suggest to use [theta_0, ,theta_1] = [1, 0.5] and [eta_0, eta_1] = [1, 1]
 (4) It takes time to run Gaussian process classification
 (5) We suggest to use C=1000, tolerance = 0.001
